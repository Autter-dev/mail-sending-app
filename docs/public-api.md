# Public REST API

## Overview

A versioned REST API at `/api/v1/*` for managing lists, contacts, suppressions, and reading campaign stats from external systems. Bearer-token auth, JSON envelope, per-key rate limiting.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

Generate keys at `/settings/api-keys`. See [api-keys.md](api-keys.md).

## Response envelope

All responses use:

```ts
{
  "data": T | null,
  "meta": { "page": number, "limit": number, "total": number } | null,
  "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "details"?: any } | null
}
```

- `200`: success, `data` populated
- `400`: validation error (Zod details in `error.details`)
- `401`: missing or invalid bearer token
- `404`: resource not found
- `429`: per-key rate limit exceeded

## Rate limiting

Each API key has its own `rate_limit_per_minute`. The limiter is implemented as a token bucket using a Postgres row-level lock in `lib/rate-limit/index.ts`. When exceeded, the response is `429` with a `Retry-After` header.
