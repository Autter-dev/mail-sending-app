# Public REST API

## Overview

A versioned REST API at `/api/v1/*` for managing lists, contacts, suppressions, and reading campaign stats from external systems. Bearer-token auth, JSON envelope, per-key rate limiting.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

Generate keys at `/settings/api-keys`. See [api-keys.md](api-keys.md).

## Response envelope

All responses use:

```ts
{
  "data": T | null,
  "meta": { "page": number, "limit": number, "total": number } | null,
  "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "details"?: any } | null
}
```

- `200`: success, `data` populated
- `400`: validation error (Zod details in `error.details`)
- `401`: missing or invalid bearer token
- `404`: resource not found
- `429`: per-key rate limit exceeded

## Rate limiting

Each API key has its own `rate_limit_per_minute`. The limiter is implemented as a token bucket using a Postgres row-level lock in `lib/rate-limit/index.ts`. When exceeded, the response is `429` with a `Retry-After` header.

## Endpoints

### Lists

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/lists` | List all lists |
| POST | `/api/v1/lists` | Create list |

### Contacts

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/lists/[listId]/contacts` | Paginated contacts. Query: `page`, `limit`, `status`, `search` |
| POST | `/api/v1/lists/[listId]/contacts` | Create one contact |
| PUT | `/api/v1/lists/[listId]/contacts/[id]` | Update contact |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/lists/[listId]/contacts/[id]` | Delete contact |
| POST | `/api/v1/lists/[listId]/contacts/bulk` | Upsert up to 1000 contacts |

### Email verification

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/email-check` | Check one address (body: `{ to_email, check_gravatar? }`). Returns full checker payload plus `verdict` and `undeliverable` (true when verdict is `invalid` or `risky`). |

New contacts from the bulk or single-contact endpoints are queued for background verification. Invalid or risky addresses become list status `undeliverable`.

Background verification runs in the **worker** (`verify-contact-email` queue). Throughput is intentionally limited so MX checks do not look like abuse: a configurable minimum delay after each probe (`EMAIL_VERIFY_MIN_GAP_MS`, default 2500 ms), one concurrent verify per worker process by default (`EMAIL_VERIFY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, max 4), and an optional enqueue stagger (`EMAIL_VERIFY_ENQUEUE_STAGGER_MS`, default 0) for large batches and backfill. The synchronous `POST /api/v1/email-check` call is not queued; it runs immediately when you call it and is still subject to per-API-key rate limits.

SMTP identity for checks comes from **Settings > Bounces** (MAIL FROM and hello name). The checker itself is integrated TypeScript code in this app (`lib/email-checker/*`), not an external or legacy WQ service.

`HIBP_API_KEY` is optional. If set, the checker queries Have I Been Pwned and includes the breach signal in `result.misc.haveibeenpwned` (`true`, `false`, or `null` on unavailable/error).

### Campaigns

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/campaigns` | Read-only list |
| GET | `/api/v1/campaigns/[id]` | Detail |
| GET | `/api/v1/campaigns/[id]/stats` | Engagement stats (see [analytics.md](analytics.md)) |

### Suppressions

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/suppressions` | Paginated list |
| POST | `/api/v1/suppressions` | Add one |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/suppressions/[id]` | Remove |
| POST | `/api/v1/suppressions/bulk` | Bulk add (max 1000) |

### GDPR
