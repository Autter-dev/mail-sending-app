## Email verification (background worker)

Queued checks use the `verify-contact-email` job in `worker.ts`. Pacing is controlled with environment variables documented in `.env.example` and `lib/email-verify-rate.ts`: minimum gap after each SMTP probe (`EMAIL_VERIFY_MIN_GAP_MS`), worker-side concurrency (`EMAIL_VERIFY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`), optional staggered scheduling on bulk enqueue and backfill (`EMAIL_VERIFY_ENQUEUE_STAGGER_MS`), plus existing SMTP timeouts and retries.

Startup backfill is enabled by default for unverified contacts and can be disabled with `EMAIL_VERIFY_BACKFILL_ON_START=false`. Use `EMAIL_VERIFY_BACKFILL_MAX` to cap startup enqueue volume.

Manual `POST /api/internal/lists/[id]/email-check` and `POST /api/v1/email-check` invoke the checker in the requesting process and do not use that queue. These checks use the SMTP identity configured in **Settings > Bounces**.

Checker calls are made through the local TypeScript client (`lib/email-checker/checkEmail.ts`) to an external checker API configured via `EMAIL_CHECKER_BASE_URL` (endpoint `/v1/check_email`). If configured, `EMAIL_CHECKER_API_SECRET` is sent as `x-api-secret`.
